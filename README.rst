HOWTO write an External for Pure Data
#####################################

Pure Data (aka Pd) is a graphical real-time computer-music system that follows the tradition of IRCAM's ISPW-Max.

Although plenty of functions are built into Pd, it is sometimes a pain or simply impossible to create a patch with a certain functionality out of the given primitives and combinations of these.

Therefore, Pd can be extended with self made primitives (“objects”) that are written in higher-level programming-languages, like C/C++, Python, lua,...

This document aims to explain how to write such primitives in C, the popular programming language that was used to implement Pd.

definitions and prerequisites
*****************************

Pd refers to the graphical real-time computer music environment
*Pure Data* by Miller S. Puckette.

To fully understand this document, it is necessary to be acquainted with Pd and to have a general understanding of programming techniques especially in C.

To write externals yourself, a C compiler that supports the ANSI C standard,
like the *GNU C compiler* (gcc) on Linux systems or
*Visual C++* on Windows platforms, will be necessary.

classes, instances, objects
===========================

Pd is written in the C programming language.
Due to its graphical nature, Pd is an *object-oriented* system.
Unfortunately, C does not support the use of classes very well.
Thus the resulting source code is not as elegant as C++ code would be, for instance.

In this document, the expression *class* refers to the realisation of a concept combining data and manipulators on this data.

Concrete *instances of a class* are called *objects*.

internals, externals and libraries
==================================

To avoid confusion of ideas, the expressions *internal*, *external* and *library* should be explained here.

Internal
--------

An *internal* is a class that is built into Pd.
Plenty of primitives, such as “+”, “pack” or “sig” are *internals*.

External
--------

An *external* is a class that is not built into Pd but is loaded at runtime.
Once loaded into Pd’s memory, *externals* cannot be distinguished from *internals* any more.

Library
-------

A *library* is a collection of *externals* that are compiled into a
single binary file.

*Library* files must follow a system-dependent naming convention:

+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
|Operating System | CPU-architecture        | filename             |
+=================+=========================+======================+
| Linux           | *unspecified*           | ``my_lib.pd_linux``  |

+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
| macOS           | amd64 (Intel 64bit)     | ``my_lib.d_amd64``   |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+

+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
| Windows         | *unspecified*           | ``my_lib.dll``       |
|                 | (any architecture)      |                      |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
| Windows         | i386 (Intel/AMD 32bit)  | ``my_lib.m_i386``    |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
| Windows         | amd64 (Intel/AMD 64bit) | ``my_lib.m_amd64``   |
+-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------+


The simplest form of a *library* includes exactly one *external* bearing the same name as the *library*.

Unlike *externals*, *libraries* can be imported by Pd with special operations.
After a *library* has been imported, all included *externals* have been loaded into memory and are available as objects.

Pd supports a few ways to import *libraries*:

-  via the command-line option “-lib my\_lib”

-  by creating a “declare -lib my\_lib” object

-  by creating a “my\_lib” object

The first method loads a *library* when Pd is started.
This method is preferably used for *libraries* that contain several *externals*.

The other method should be used for *libraries* that contain exactly one
*external* bearing the same name. Pd checks first, whether a class named
“my\_lib” is already loaded. If this is not the case [#]_, all paths are
searched for a file called “my\_lib.pd\_linux” [#]_. If such file is
found, all included *externals* are loaded into memory by calling a
``my_lib_setup()`` function. After loading, a “my\_lib” class is (again)
looked for as a (newly loaded) *external*. If so, an instance of this
class is created, else the instantiation fails and an error is printed.
Anyhow, all *external* classes declared in the *library* are loaded by
now.

.. [#] If a class “my\_lib” is already existent, an object “my\_lib” will be instantiated and the procedure is done. Thus, no *library* has been loaded. Therefore no *library* that is named like an already used class name like, say, “abs”, can be loaded.

.. [#] or other system-dependent filename extensions (s.a.)


Writing externals
*****************

my first external: helloworld
=============================

Usually the first attempt at learning a programming language is
a “hello world” application.

In our case, we will create an object class that prints the line
“Hello world !!” to the standard error every time it is triggered with a
“bang” message.

the interface to Pd
-------------------

To write a Pd external, a well-defined interface is needed. This is
provided by the header file “m\_pd.h”.

::

    #include "m_pd.h"

a class and its data space
--------------------------

First a new class must be prepared and the data space for this class
must be defined.

::

    static t_class *helloworld_class;

    typedef struct _helloworld {
      t_object  x_obj;
    } t_helloworld;

``helloworld_class`` is going to be a pointer to the new class.

Structure ``t_helloworld`` (of type ``struct _helloworld``) is the data
space of the class.

An absolutely necessary element of the data space is a variable of
type ``t_object``, which is used to store internal object properties
like the graphical presentation of the object or data about inlets and
outlets.

``t_object`` must be the first entry in the structure!

Because a simple “hello world” application needs no variables,
the structure is empty apart from the ``t_object``.

method space
------------

In addition to the data space, a class needs a set of manipulators
(methods) to manipulate the data with.

If a message is sent to an instance of our class, a method is called.
These methods are the interfaces to Pd's message system.
On principle, they have no return argument and are therefore of type
``void``.

::

    void helloworld_bang(t_helloworld *x)
    {
      post("Hello world !!");
    }

This method takes an argument of type ``t_helloworld``, which would
enable us to manipulate the data space.

But since we only want to output “Hello world !!” (and, by the way, our data
space is quite sparse), we simply ignore the argument.

The ``post(char *c,...)`` function sends a string to the standard error.
A carriage return is added automatically. Apart from this, the
``post`` function works like the C ``printf()`` function.

generation of a new class
-------------------------

To generate a new class, information on the data space and the method
space of this class must be passed to Pd when a library is loaded.

On loading a new library named “my\_lib”, Pd tries to call a “my\_lib\_setup()”
function. This function (or functions called by it) declares
the new classes and their properties. It is only called once, when the
library is loaded. If the function call fails (e.g., because no function
of the specified name is present) no external of the library will be
loaded.

::

    void helloworld_setup(void)
    {
      helloworld_class = class_new(gensym("helloworld"),
            (t_newmethod)helloworld_new,
            0, sizeof(t_helloworld),
            CLASS_DEFAULT, 0);

      class_addbang(helloworld_class, helloworld_bang);
    }

class\_new
^^^^^^^^^^

Function ``class_new`` creates a new class and returns a pointer to
this prototype.

The first argument is the symbolic name of the class.

The next two arguments define the constructor and destructor of the class.

Whenever a class object is created in a Pd patch,
class constructor ``(t_newmethod)helloworld_new`` instantiates the object
and initialises the data space.

Whenever an object is destroyed (either by closing the containing patch or by deleting the object from the patch)
the destructor frees the dynamically reserved memory.
The allocated memory for the static data space is automatically reserved and freed.

Therefore we need not provide a destructor in this example, the
argument is set to “0”.

To enable Pd to reserve and free enough memory for the static data
space, the size of the data structure must be passed as the fourth
argument.

The fifth argument has influence on the graphical representation of the
class objects. The default value is ``CLASS_DEFAULT`` or simply “0”.

The remaining arguments define the arguments of an object and its type.

Up to six numeric and symbolic object arguments can be defined via
``A_DEFFLOAT`` and ``A_DEFSYMBOL``. If more arguments are to be passed
to the object, or if the order of atom types should be more flexible,
``A_GIMME`` can be used for passing an arbitrary list of atoms.

The list of object arguments is terminated by “0”. In this example we
have no object arguments at all for the class.

class\_addbang
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We still need to add a method space to the class.

``class_addbang`` adds a method for a “bang” message to the class that
is defined in the first argument. The added method is defined in the
second argument.

constructor: instantiation of an object
---------------------------------------

Each time, an object is created in a Pd patch, the constructor that is
defined with the ``class_new`` function, generates a new instance of the
class.

The constructor must be of type ``void *``.

::

    void *helloworld_new(void)
    {
      t_helloworld *x = (t_helloworld *)pd_new(helloworld_class);

      return (void *)x;
    }

The arguments of the constructor method depend on the object arguments
defined with ``class_new``.

+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``class_new`` argument   | constructor argument                      |
+==========================+===========================================+
| ``A_DEFFLOAT``           | ``t_floatarg f``                          |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``A_DEFSYMBOL``          | ``t_symbol *s``                           |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``A_GIMME``              | ``t_symbol *s, int argc, t_atom *argv``   |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Because there are no object arguments for our “hello world” class,
the constructor has none too.

Function ``pd_new`` reserves memory for the data space, initialises
the variables that are internal to the object and returns a pointer to
the data space.

The type cast to the data space is necessary.

Normally, the constructor would initialise the object variables.
However, since we have none, this is not necessary.

The constructor must return a pointer to the instantiated data space.
If it returns ``NULL``, Pd think the object did not create.

the code: helloworld
--------------------

::

    #include "m_pd.h"

    static t_class *helloworld_class;

    typedef struct _helloworld {
      t_object  x_obj;
    } t_helloworld;

    void helloworld_bang(t_helloworld *x)
    {
      post("Hello world !!");
    }

    void *helloworld_new(void)
    {
      t_helloworld *x = (t_helloworld *)pd_new(helloworld_class);

      return (void *)x;
    }

    void helloworld_setup(void) {
      helloworld_class = class_new(gensym("helloworld"),
            (t_newmethod)helloworld_new,
            0, sizeof(t_helloworld),
            CLASS_DEFAULT, 0);
      class_addbang(helloworld_class, helloworld_bang);
    }

a simple external: counter
==========================

Now we want to realize a simple counter as an external.
A “bang” trigger outputs the counter value on the outlet
and afterwards increases the counter value by 1.

This class is similar to the previous one, but the data space is
extended by variable “counter” and the result is written as a message
to an outlet instead of a string to the standard error.

object variables
----------------

Of course, a counter needs a state variable to store the actual
counter value.

State variables that belong to class instances belong to the data space.

::

    typedef struct _counter {
      t_object  x_obj;
      int i_count;
    } t_counter;

Integer variable ``i_count`` stores the counter value.

object arguments
----------------

It is quite useful for a counter, if an initial value can be defined by
the user. Therefore this initial value should be passed to the object at
creation time.

::

    void counter_setup(void) {
      counter_class = class_new(gensym("counter"),
            (t_newmethod)counter_new,
            0, sizeof(t_counter),
            CLASS_DEFAULT,
            A_DEFFLOAT, 0);

      class_addbang(counter_class, counter_bang);
    }

So we have an additional argument in function ``class_new``:
``A_DEFFLOAT`` tells Pd that the object needs one argument of the type
``t_floatarg``.
If no argument is passed, this will default to “0”.

constructor
-----------

The constructor has some new tasks.
On the one hand, a variable value must be initialised,
on the other hand, an outlet for the object has to be created.

::

    void *counter_new(t_floatarg f)
    {
      t_counter *x = (t_counter *)pd_new(counter_class);

      x->i_count=f;
      outlet_new(&x->x_obj, &s_float);

      return (void *)x;
    }

The constructor method has one argument of type ``t_floatarg`` as
declared in the setup function by ``class_new``. This argument is used to
initialise the counter.

A new outlet is created with function ``outlet_new``. The first
argument is a pointer to the internals of the object the new outlet is
created for.

The second argument is a symbolic description of the outlet type. Since
our counter should output numeric values it is of type “float”.

``outlet_new`` returns a pointer to the new outlet and saves this very
pointer in the ``t_object`` variable ``x_obj.ob_outlet``. If only one
outlet is used, the pointer need not additionally be stored in the data
space. If more than one outlets are used, the pointers must be stored
in the data space, because the ``t_object`` variable can only hold one
outlet pointer.

the counter method
------------------

When triggered, the counter's value should be sent to the outlet and
afterwards be incremented by 1.

::

    void counter_bang(t_counter *x)
    {
      t_float f=x->i_count;
      x->i_count++;
      outlet_float(x->x_obj.ob_outlet, f);
    }

Function ``outlet_float`` sends a floating point value (second argument)
to the outlet specified by the first argument.

We first store the counter in a floating point buffer.
Afterwards the counter is incremented and not before that the buffer variable
is sent to the outlet.

What appears to be unnecessary at first glance, makes sense after
further inspection: the buffer variable has been declared as a
``t_float``, since ``outlet_float`` expects a floating point value and a
typecast is inevitable.

If the counter value was sent to the outlet before being incremented,
this could result in unwanted (though well defined) behaviour: if the
counter outlet directly triggered its own inlet, the counter method
would be called although the counter value was not yet incremented.
Normally this is not what we want.

The same (correct) result could of course be obtained with a single
line, but this would obscure the *reentrant* problem.

the code: counter
-----------------

::

    #include "m_pd.h"

    static t_class *counter_class;

    typedef struct _counter {
      t_object  x_obj;
      int i_count;
    } t_counter;

    void counter_bang(t_counter *x)
    {
      t_float f=x->i_count;
      x->i_count++;
      outlet_float(x->x_obj.ob_outlet, f);
    }

    void *counter_new(t_floatarg f)
    {
      t_counter *x = (t_counter *)pd_new(counter_class);

      x->i_count=f;
      outlet_new(&x->x_obj, &s_float);

      return (void *)x;
    }

    void counter_setup(void) {
      counter_class = class_new(gensym("counter"),
            (t_newmethod)counter_new,
            0, sizeof(t_counter),
            CLASS_DEFAULT,
            A_DEFFLOAT, 0);

      class_addbang(counter_class, counter_bang);
    }

a complex external: counter
===========================

The simple counter of the previous chapter can easily be extended to
more complexity. It might be quite useful to be able to reset the
counter to an initial value, to set upper and lower boundaries and to
control the step width. Each overrun should send a “bang” message to a
second outlet and reset the counter to the initial value.

extended data space
-------------------

::

    typedef struct _counter {
      t_object  x_obj;
      int i_count;
      t_float step;
      int i_down, i_up;
      t_outlet *f_out, *b_out;
    } t_counter;

The data space has been extended to hold variables for step width and upper and lower boundaries.
Furthermore pointers for two outlets have been added.

extension of the class
----------------------

The new class objects should have methods for different messages,
like “set” and “reset”.
Therefore the method space must be extended too.

::

      counter_class = class_new(gensym("counter"),
            (t_newmethod)counter_new,
            0, sizeof(t_counter),
            CLASS_DEFAULT, 
            A_GIMME, 0);

Class generator ``class_new`` has been extended by the argument ``A_GIMME``.
This enables a dynamic number of arguments to be passed at object instantiation.

::

      class_addmethod(counter_class,
            (t_method)counter_reset,
            gensym("reset"), 0);

``class_addmethod`` adds a method for an arbitrary selector to a class.

The first argument is the class the method (second argument) will be added to.

The third argument is the symbolic selector that should be associated with the method.

The remaining “0”-terminated arguments describe the list of atoms that follows the selector.

::

      class_addmethod(counter_class,
            (t_method)counter_set, gensym("set"),
            A_DEFFLOAT, 0);
      class_addmethod(counter_class,
            (t_method)counter_bound, gensym("bound"),
            A_DEFFLOAT, A_DEFFLOAT, 0);

A method for “set” followed by a numerical value is added, as well as a method for the selector “bound” followed by two numerical values.

::

      class_sethelpsymbol(counter_class, gensym("help-counter"));

If a Pd object is right-clicked, a help patch describing the
object's class can be opened.
By default, this patch is located in directory “\ *doc/5.reference/*\ ”
and is named like the symbolic class name.

An alternative help patch can be defined using function ``class_sethelpsymbol``.

construction of in- and outlets
-------------------------------

When creating the object, several arguments should be passed by the user.

::

    void *counter_new(t_symbol *s, int argc, t_atom *argv)

Because of the declaration of arguments in function ``class_new``
with ``A_GIMME``, the constructor has the following arguments:

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``t_symbol *s``    | the symbolic name used for object creation     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``int argc``       | the number of arguments passed to the object   |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``t_atom *argv``   | a pointer to a list of argc atoms              |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

::

      t_float f1=0, f2=0;

      x->step=1;
      switch(argc){
      default:
      case 3:
        x->step=atom_getfloat(argv+2);
      case 2:
        f2=atom_getfloat(argv+1);
      case 1:
        f1=atom_getfloat(argv);
        break;
      case 0:
        break;
      }
      if (argc<2)f2=f1;
      x->i_down = (f1<f2)?f1:f2;
      x->i_up   = (f1>f2)?f1:f2;

      x->i_count=x->i_down;

If three arguments are passed, these should be the *lower boundary*, the *upper boundary* and the *step width*.

If only two arguments are passed, the step width defaults to “1”.
If only one argument is passed, this should be the *initial value* of the
counter with step width of “1”.

::

      inlet_new(&x->x_obj, &x->x_obj.ob_pd,
            gensym("list"), gensym("bound"));

Function ``inlet_new`` creates a new “active” inlet.
“Active” means, that a class method is called each time a message is sent
to an “active” inlet.

Due to the software architecture, the first inlet is always “active”.

The first two arguments of the ``inlet_new`` function are pointers to
the internals of the object and to the graphical presentation of the
object.

The symbolic selector that is specified by the third argument is to be substituted by another symbolic selector (fourth argument) for this inlet.

Because of this substitution of selectors, a message on a certain right inlet can be treated as a message with a certain selector on the leftmost inlet.

This means:

-  The substituting selector must be declared by ``class_addmethod``
   in the setup function.

-  It is possible to simulate a certain right inlet, by sending a message with this inlet’s selector to the leftmost inlet.

-  It is not possible to add methods for more than one selector to a right inlet.
   Particularly, it is not possible to add a universal method for arbitrary selectors to a right inlet.

::

      floatinlet_new(&x->x_obj, &x->step);

``floatinlet_new`` generates a new “passive” inlet for numerical values.
“Passive” inlets allow parts of the data space memory to be written
directly from outside. Therefore it is not possible to check for illegal
inputs.

The first argument is a pointer to the internal infrastructure of the
object. The second argument is the address in the data space memory,
where other objects can write too.

“Passive” inlets can be created for pointers, symbolic or numerical (floating point [#]_ ) values.


::

      x->f_out = outlet_new(&x->x_obj, &s_float);
      x->b_out = outlet_new(&x->x_obj, &s_bang);

The pointers returned by ``outlet_new`` must be saved in the
class data space to be used later by the outlet functions.

The order of the generation of inlets and outlets is important, since it corresponds to the order of inlets and outlets in the graphical representation of the object.

.. [#] That’s why the step width of the classdata space is declared as t\_float.

extended method space
---------------------

The method for the “bang” message must fulfill the more complex tasks.

::

    void counter_bang(t_counter *x)
    {
      t_float f=x->i_count;
      int step = x->step;
      x->i_count+=step;
      if (x->i_down-x->i_up) {
        if ((step>0) && (x->i_count > x->i_up)) {
          x->i_count = x->i_down;
          outlet_bang(x->b_out);
        } else if (x->i_count < x->i_down) {
          x->i_count = x->i_up;
          outlet_bang(x->b_out);
        }
      }
      outlet_float(x->f_out, f);
    }

Each outlet is identified by the ``outlet_...`` functions via the
pointer to this outlets.

The remaining methods still need to be implemented:

::

    void counter_reset(t_counter *x)
    {
      x->i_count = x->i_down;
    }

    void counter_set(t_counter *x, t_floatarg f)
    {

a signal-external: xfade~
=========================

Signal classes are normal Pd classes, that offer additional
methods for signals.

All methods and concepts that can be realized with normal object classes can therefore be realized with signal classes too.

Per agreement, the symbolic names of signal classes end with a tilde .

The class “xfade” shall demonstrate, how signal classes are written.

A signal on the left inlet is crossfaded with a signal on the second inlet.
The mixing factor between 0 and 1 is defined via a ``t_float``-message
to the third inlet.

variables of a signal class
---------------------------

Since a signal class is only an extended normal class,
there are no principal differences between the data spaces.

::

    typedef struct _xfade_tilde {
      t_object x_obj;

      t_float x_pan;
      t_float f;

      t_inlet *x_in2;
      t_inlet *x_in3;

      t_outlet*x_out;

    } t_xfade_tilde;

Only one variable ``x_pan`` for the *mixing factor* of the crossfade function
is needed.

The other variable, ``f``, is needed whenever a signal inlet is needed too.
If no signal but only a float message is present at a signal inlet,
this variable is used to automatically convert the float to signal.

Finally, we have members ``x_in2``, ``x_in3`` and ``x_out``,
which are needed to store handles to the various extra inlets (resp. outlets)
of the object.

signal classes
--------------

::

    void xfade_tilde_setup(void) {
      xfade_tilde_class = class_new(gensym("xfade~"),
            (t_newmethod)xfade_tilde_new,
            (t_method)xfade_tilde_free,
            sizeof(t_xfade_tilde),
            CLASS_DEFAULT, 
            A_DEFFLOAT, 0);

      class_addmethod(xfade_tilde_class,
            (t_method)xfade_tilde_dsp, gensym("dsp"), A_CANT, 0);
      CLASS_MAINSIGNALIN(xfade_tilde_class, t_xfade_tilde, f);
    }

Something has changed with the ``class_new`` function:
the third argument specifies a “free method” (aka *destructor*),
which is called whenever an instance of the object is to be deleted
(just like the “new method” is called whenever an instance is to be created).
In the prior examples this was set to ``0`` (meaning: we don’t care),
but in this example we want to clean up some resources when we don’t
need them any more.

More interestingly, a method for signal processing must be provided
by each signal class.

Whenever Pd’s audio engine is started, a message with the selector “dsp”
is sent to each object.
Each class that has a method for the “dsp” message is recognised
as a signal class.
*Always* mark the arguments following the “dsp” selector as ``A_CANT``,
as this will make it impossible to manually send an *illegal* ``dsp``
message to the object, triggering a crash.

Signal classes that want to provide signal inlets
must declare this via the ``CLASS_MAINSIGNALIN`` macro.
This enables signals at the first (default) inlet.
If more than one signal inlet is needed,
they must be created explicitly in the constructor method.

Inlets that are declared as signal inlets
cannot provide methods for ``t_float`` messages any longer.

The first argument of the macro is a pointer to the signal class.
The second argument is the type of the class’ data space.

The last argument is a dummy variable out of the data space
that is needed to replace nonexisting signal at the (first)
signal inlet with ``t_float``-messages.

construction of signal inlets and outlets
-----------------------------------------

::

    void *xfade_tilde_new(t_floatarg f)
    {
      t_xfade_tilde *x = (t_xfade_tilde *)pd_new(xfade_tilde_class);

      x->x_pan = f;

      x->x_in2 = inlet_new(&x->x_obj, &x->x_obj.ob_pd, &s_signal, &s_signal);
      x->x_in3 = floatinlet_new (&x->x_obj, &x->x_pan);

      x->x_out = outlet_new(&x->x_obj, &s_signal);

      return (void *)x;
    }

Additional signal inlets are added like other inlets, using
function ``inlet_new``. The last two arguments are references to the
“signal” symbolic selector in the lookup table.

Signal outlets are also created like normal (message) outlets, by
setting the outlet selector to “signal”.

The newly created inlets/outlets are “user-allocated” data. Pd will keep
track of all the resources it automatically creates (like the default
inlet), and will eventually free these resources once they are no longer
needed. However, if we request “extra” resources (like the additional
inlets/outlets in this example; or - more commonly - memory that is
allocated via ``malloc`` or similar), we ourselves must make sure
that these resources are freed when no longer needed. If we fail to do
so, we will invariably cause a dreaded *memory leak*.

Therefore, we store the “handles” to the newly created inlets/outlets as
returned by the ``..._new`` functions for later use.

DSP methods
-----------

Whenever Pd’s audio engine is turned on, all signal objects declare
their perform routines that are to be added to the DSP tree.

The “dsp” method has two arguments, the pointer to the class data space,
and a pointer to an array of signals. The signal array consists of the
input signals (from left to right) and then the output signals (from
left to right).

::

    void xfade_tilde_dsp(t_xfade_tilde *x, t_signal **sp)
    {
      dsp_add(xfade_tilde_perform, 5, x,
              sp[0]->s_vec, sp[1]->s_vec, sp[2]->s_vec, sp[0]->s_n);
    }

``dsp_add`` adds a *perform* function (as declared in the first argument)
to the DSP tree.

The second argument is the number of the following pointers to diverse variables.
Which pointers to which variables are passed is not limited.

Here, sp[0] is the first input signal, sp[1] represents the second
input signal and sp[2] points to the output signal.

Structure ``t_signal`` contains a pointer to its signal vector
``().s_vec`` (an array of samples of type ``t_sample``), and the length
of this signal vector ``().s_n``.

Since all the signal vectors in a patch (not including its subpatches) are
of the same length, it is sufficient to get the length of one of these
vectors.

Since an object doesn't know its *perform* function's signal vector
length until the "dsp" method, this would be the place to allocate
temporary buffers to store intermediate dsp computations.
See: *getbytes*.

perform function
----------------

The perform function is the DSP heart of each signal class.

A pointer to an array of pointers (really: pointer sized integers)
is passed to it.
This array contains the pointers that were passed via ``dsp_add``,
which must be cast back to their real type.

The perform function must return an address,
that is just behind the stored pointers of the function.
This means that the return argument equals the argument of the perform function
plus the number of pointer variables (as declared as the second argument of
``dsp_add``) plus one.

::

    t_int *xfade_tilde_perform(t_int *w)
    {
      t_xfade_tilde *x = (t_xfade_tilde *)(w[1]);
      t_sample    *in1 =      (t_sample *)(w[2]);
      t_sample    *in2 =      (t_sample *)(w[3]);
      t_sample    *out =      (t_sample *)(w[4]);
      int            n =             (int)(w[5]);

      t_sample pan = (x->x_pan<0)?0.0:(x->x_pan>1)?1.0:x->x_pan;

      while (n--) *out++ = (*in1++)*(1-pan)+(*in2++)*pan;

      return (w+6);
    }

Each sample of the signal vectors is read and manipulated in the
``while`` loop.

Optimisation of the DSP tree tries to avoid unnecessary copy operations.
Therefore it is possible, that in and out signals are located at the
same address in the memory. In this case, the programmer must be
careful not to write into the out signal before having read the
in signal to avoid overwriting data that is not yet saved.

destructor
----------

::

    void xfade_tilde_free(t_xfade_tilde *x)
    {
      inlet_free(x->x_in2);
      inlet_free(x->x_in3);
      outlet_free(x->x_out);
    }

If our object has some dynamically allocated resources
(usually this is dynamically allocated memory),
we must free them manually in the “free method” (aka: destructor).

In the example above, we do so by calling ``inlet_free`` (resp. ``outlet_free``) on the handles to our additional iolets.

*NOTE*: we do not really need to free inlets and outlet, as Pd will
automatically free them for us (unless we are doing higher-order magic,
like displaying one object's iolet as another object's. but let's not get
into that for now...)

the code: xfade~
----------------

::

    #include "m_pd.h"

    static t_class *xfade_tilde_class;

    typedef struct _xfade_tilde {
      t_object x_obj;
      t_float x_pan;
      t_float f;

      t_inlet *x_in2;
      t_inlet *x_in3;
      t_outlet*x_out;
    } t_xfade_tilde;

    t_int *xfade_tilde_perform(t_int *w)
    {
      t_xfade_tilde *x = (t_xfade_tilde *)(w[1]);

      int            n =             (int)(w[5]);
      t_sample pan = (x->x_pan<0)?0.0:(x->x_pan>1)?1.0:x->x_pan;

      while (n--) *out++ = (*in1++)*(1-pan)+(*in2++)*pan;

      return (w+6);
    }

    void xfade_tilde_dsp(t_xfade_tilde *x, t_signal **sp)
    {
      dsp_add(xfade_tilde_perform, 5, x,
              sp[0]->s_vec, sp[1]->s_vec, sp[2]->s_vec, sp[0]->s_n);
    }

    void xfade_tilde_free(t_xfade_tilde *x)
    {
      inlet_free(x->x_in2);
      inlet_free(x->x_in3);
      outlet_free(x->x_out);
    }

    void *xfade_tilde_new(t_floatarg f)
    {
      t_xfade_tilde *x = (t_xfade_tilde *)pd_new(xfade_tilde_class);

      x->x_pan = f;
      
      x->x_in2=inlet_new(&x->x_obj, &x->x_obj.ob_pd, &s_signal, &s_signal);
      x->x_in3=floatinlet_new (&x->x_obj, &x->x_pan);
      x->x_out=outlet_new(&x->x_obj, &s_signal);

      return (void *)x;
    }

    void xfade_tilde_setup(void) {
      xfade_tilde_class = class_new(gensym("xfade~"),
            (t_newmethod)xfade_tilde_new,
            0, sizeof(t_xfade_tilde),
            CLASS_DEFAULT, 
            A_DEFFLOAT, 0);

      class_addmethod(xfade_tilde_class,
            (t_method)xfade_tilde_dsp, gensym("dsp"), A_CANT, 0);
      CLASS_MAINSIGNALIN(xfade_tilde_class, t_xfade_tilde, f);
    }

Pd’s message system
*******************

Non-audio data is distributed via a message system. Each message
consists of a “selector” and a list of atoms.

atoms
=====

There are three kinds of atoms:

-  *A\_FLOAT*: a numerical value (floating point)

-  *A\_SYMBOL*: a symbolic value (string)

-  *A\_POINTER*: a pointer

Numerical values are always floating point values (``t_float``), even if
they could be displayed as integer values.

Each symbol is stored in a lookup table for performance reasons.
Function ``gensym`` looks up a string in the lookup table and returns the
address of the symbol. If the string is not yet to be found in the
table, a new symbol is added.

Atoms of type *A\_POINTER* are not very important (for simple externals).

The type of an atom ``a`` is stored in structure element ``a.a_type``.

selectors
=========

The selector is a symbol that defines the type of a message.
There are five predefined selectors:

-  “bang” labels a trigger event.
   A “bang” message consists only of the selector and contains no lists of atoms.

-  “float” labels a numerical value.
   The list of a “float” message contains one single atom of type *A\_FLOAT*.

-  “symbol” labels a symbolic value.
   The list of a “symbol” message contains one single atom of type *A\_SYMBOL*.

-  “pointer” labels a pointer value.
   The list of a “pointer” message contains one single atom of type *A\_POINTER*.

-  “list” labels a list of one or more atoms of arbitrary type.

Since the symbols for these selectors are used quite often,
their address in the lookup table can be queried directly,
without having to use ``gensym``:

+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| selector     | lookup function call    | lookup address   |
+==============+=========================+==================+
| bang         | ``gensym("bang")``      | ``&s_bang``      |
+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| float        | ``gensym("float")``     | ``&s_float``     |
+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| symbol       | ``gensym("symbol")``    | ``&s_symbol``    |
+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| pointer      | ``gensym("pointer")``   | ``&s_pointer``   |
+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| list         | ``gensym("list")``      | ``&s_list``      |
+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+
| — (signal)   | ``gensym("signal")``    | ``&s_signal``    |
+--------------+-------------------------+------------------+

Other selectors can be used as well.
The receiving class must provide a method for a specific selector
or for “anything”, which is any arbitrary selector.

Messages that have no explicit selector and start with a numerical value,
are recognised automatically either as “float” message (only one atom)
or as “list” message (several atoms).

For example, messages “\ ``12.429``\ ” and “\ ``float 12.429``\ ” are identical.
Likewise, the messages “\ ``list 1 for you``\ ” is identical to “\ ``1 for you``\ ”.

Pd types
========

Since Pd is used on several platforms, many ordinary types of variables,
like ``float``, are redefined.
To write portable code, it is advisable to use types provided by Pd.

Apart from this there are many predefined types, which should make the life of the programmer simpler.

Generally, Pd types start with ``t_``.

If memory is reserved dynamically,
this memory must be freed by the destructor method ``freemethod``
(without any return argument), when the object is destroyed.

``size`` is the static size of the class data space that is returned by
``sizeof(t_mydata)``.

``flags`` define the presentation of the graphical object. A (more or
less arbitrary) combination of the following values is possible:

The remaining arguments ``arg1,...`` define the types of
object arguments passed at the creation of a class object. A maximum of
six type-checked arguments can be passed to an object. The list of
argument types is terminated by “0”.

Possible argument types are:

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ``A_DEFFLOAT``    | a numerical value                               |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ``A_GIMME``       | a list of atoms of arbitrary length and types   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

If more than six arguments are to be passed,
``A_GIMME`` must be used and a manual type check must be made.

class\_addmethod
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addmethod(t_class *c, t_method fn, t_symbol *sel,
        t_atomtype arg1, ...);

Adds method ``fn`` for selector ``sel`` to class ``c``.

The remaining arguments ``arg1,...`` define the types of the list of atoms that follow the selector.
A maximum of six type-checked arguments can be passed.
If more than six arguments are to be passed, ``A_GIMME`` must be used and a manual type check must be made.

The list of arguments is terminated by “0”.

Possible types of arguments are:

| ``A_DEFFLOAT``    | a numerical value (default to '0')               |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``A_FLOAT``       | an obligatory numerical value (no default value) |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| ``A_DEFSYMBOL``   | a symbolic value (default to '')                 |

+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

class\_addbang
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addbang(t_class *c, t_method fn);

Adds method ``fn`` for “bang”-messages to class ``c``.

The argument of the “bang” method is a pointer to the class data space:

``void my_bang_method(t_mydata *x);``

class\_addfloat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addfloat(t_class *c, t_method fn);

Adds method ``fn`` for “float” messages to class ``c``.

The arguments of the “float” method are a pointer to the class data space
and a floating point argument:

``void my_float_method(t_mydata *x, t_floatarg f);``

class\_addsymbol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addsymbol(t_class *c, t_method fn);

Adds method ``fn`` for “symbol” messages to class ``c``.

The arguments of the “symbol” method are a pointer to the class data space
and a pointer to the passed symbol:

``void my_symbol_method(t_mydata *x, t_symbol *s);``

class\_addpointer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addpointer(t_class *c, t_method fn);

Adds method ``fn`` for “pointer” messages to class ``c``.

The arguments of the “pointer” method are a pointer to the class data space
and a pointer to a pointer:

``void my_pointer_method(t_mydata *x, t_gpointer *pt);``

class\_addlist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addlist(t_class *c, t_method fn);

Adds method ``fn`` for “list” messages to class ``c``.

The arguments of the “list” method are
– apart from a pointer to the class data space –
a pointer to the selector symbol (always ``&s_list``),
the number of atoms and a pointer to the list of atoms:

``void my_list_method(t_mydata *x,``

``t_symbol *s, int argc, t_atom *argv);``

class\_addanything
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_addanything(t_class *c, t_method fn);

Adds method ``fn`` for an arbitrary message to class ``c``.

The arguments of the anything method are
– apart from a pointer to the class data space –
a pointer to the selector symbol,
the number of atoms and a pointer to the list of atoms:

``void my_any_method(t_mydata *x,``

``t_symbol *s, int argc, t_atom *argv);``

class\_addcreator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

     void class_addcreator(t_newmethod newmethod, t_symbol *s, 
        t_atomtype type1, ...);

Adds creator symbol ``s``, alternative to the symbolic class name, to
constructor ``newmethod``. Thus, objects can be created either by
their “real” class name or an alias name (e.g. an abbreviation, like the
internal “float” resp. “f”).

The “0”-terminated list of types corresponds to that of ``class_new``.

class\_sethelpsymbol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void class_sethelpsymbol(t_class *c, t_symbol *s);

If a Pd object is right-clicked, a help patch for the corresponding
object class can be opened.
By default, this is a patch with the symbolic class name
in the directory “\ *doc/5.reference/*\ ”.

The name of the help patch for the class pointed to by ``c`` is
changed to symbol ``s``.

Therefore, several similar classes can share a single help patch.

The path is relative to the default help directory *doc/5.reference/*.

pd\_new
^^^^^^^

::

    t_pd *pd_new(t_class *cls);

Generates a new instance of class ``cls``
and returns a pointer to this instance.

functions: inlets and outlets
-----------------------------

All functions for inlets and outlets need a reference to the
object internals of the class instance.
When instantiating a new object,
the necessary data space variable of the ``t_object`` type is
initialised. This variable must be passed as the ``owner`` object to
the various inlet and outlet functions.

inlet\_new
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    t_inlet *inlet_new(t_object *owner, t_pd *dest,
          t_symbol *s1, t_symbol *s2);

Generates an additional “active” inlet for the object pointed at by ``owner``.
Generally, ``dest`` points at “\ ``owner.ob_pd``\ ”.

Selector ``s1`` at the new inlet is substituted by selector ``s2``.

If a message with selector ``s1`` appears at the new inlet,
the class method for selector ``s2`` is called.

This means:

-  The substituting selector must be declared by ``class_addmethod``
   in the setup function.

-  It is possible to simulate a certain right inlet, by sending a message with this inlet’s selector to the leftmost inlet.

   Using an empty symbol (``gensym("")``) as selector makes it impossible to address a right inlet via the leftmost one.

-  It is not possible to add methods for more than one selector to a
   right inlet. Particularly, it is not possible to add a universal
   method for arbitrary selectors to a right inlet.

floatinlet\_new
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    t_inlet *floatinlet_new(t_object *owner, t_float *fp);

Generates a new “passive” inlet for the object pointed at by ``owner``.
This inlet enables numerical values to be written directly
into the memory location pointed at by ``fp``,
without calling a dedicated method.

symbolinlet\_new
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    t_inlet *symbolinlet_new(t_object *owner, t_symbol **sp);

Generates a new “passive” inlet for the object pointed at by ``owner``.
This inlet enables symbolic values to be written directly
into the memory  location pointed at by ``*sp``,
without calling a dedicated method.

pointerinlet\_new
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    t_inlet *pointerinlet_new(t_object *owner, t_gpointer *gp);

Generates a new “passive” inlet for the object pointed at by ``owner``.
This inlet enables pointer to be written directly into the
memory location pointed at by ``gp``,
without calling a dedicated method.

outlet\_new
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    t_outlet *outlet_new(t_object *owner, t_symbol *s);

Generates a new outlet for the object pointed at by ``owner``.
Symbol ``s`` indicates the type of the outlet.

+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| symbol      | symbol address    | outlet type         |
+=============+===================+=====================+
| “bang”      | ``&s_bang``       | message (bang)      |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| “float”     | ``&s_float``      | message (float)     |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| “symbol”    | ``&s_symbol``     | message (symbol)    |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| “pointer”   | ``&s_gpointer``   | message (pointer)   |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| “list”      | ``&s_list``       | message (list)      |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| —           | 0                 | message             |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| “signal”    | ``&s_signal``     | signal              |
+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+

There are no real differences between outlets of the various message types.
At any rate, it makes code more easily readable, if the use of outlet is shown at creation time.
For outlets for any-type messages, a null pointer is used.
Signal outlet must be declared with ``&s_signal``.

Variables of type ``t_object`` provide pointers to one outlet.
Whenever a new outlet is generated, its address is stored in object
variable ``(*owner).ob_outlet``.

If more than one message outlet is needed, the outlet pointers
returned by ``outlet_new`` must be stored manually in the data space
so you can later address the given outlet.

outlet\_bang
^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void outlet_bang(t_outlet *x);

Outputs a “bang”-message at the outlet specified by ``x``.

outlet\_float
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void outlet_float(t_outlet *x, t_float f);

Outputs a “float”-message with numeric value ``f``
at the outlet specified by ``x``.

outlet\_symbol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void outlet_symbol(t_outlet *x, t_symbol *s);

Outputs a “symbol”-message with symbolic value ``s``
at the outlet specified by ``x``.

outlet\_pointer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void outlet_pointer(t_outlet *x, t_gpointer *gp);

Outputs a “pointer” message with pointer ``gp``
at the outlet specified by ``x``.

outlet\_list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void outlet_list(t_outlet *x,
                     t_symbol *s, int argc, t_atom *argv);

Outputs a “list” message at the outlet specified by ``x``.
The list contains ``argc`` atoms.
``argv`` points to the first element of the atom list.

Independent of symbol ``s``, selector “list” will precede the list.

To make the code more readable, ``s`` should point to the symbol list (either via ``gensym("list")`` or via ``&s_list``).

outlet\_anything
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void outlet_anything(t_outlet *x,
                         t_symbol *s, int argc, t_atom *argv);

Outputs a message at the outlet specified by ``x``.

The message selector is specified with ``s``.
It is followed by ``argc`` atoms.
``argv`` points to the first element of the atom list.

functions: DSP
--------------

If a class is to provide methods for digital signal processing,
a method for selector “dsp” (followed by no atoms) must be added to the class.

Whenever Pd’s audio engine is started, all the objects providing a
“dsp” method are identified as instances of signal classes.

DSP method
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    void my_dsp_method(t_mydata *x, t_signal **sp)

In the “dsp” method, a method for signal processing is added to the
DSP tree by function ``dsp_add``.

Apart from the data space ``x`` of the object, an array of signals is
passed. The signals in the array are arranged from left to right,
first the inlets, then the outlets.

In case there are both two in and out signals, this means:

+-----------+--------------------+
| pointer   | to signal          |
+===========+====================+
| sp[0]     | left in signal     |
+-----------+--------------------+
| sp[1]     | right in signal    |
+-----------+--------------------+
| sp[2]     | left out signal    |
+-----------+--------------------+
| sp[3]     | right out signal   |
+-----------+--------------------+

The signal structure contains apart from other things:

+---------------------+--------------------------------+
| structure element   | description                    |
+=====================+================================+
| ``s_n``             | length of the signal vector    |
+---------------------+--------------------------------+
| ``s_vec``           | pointer to the signal vector   |
+---------------------+--------------------------------+

The signal vector is an array of samples of type ``t_sample``.

perform function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    t_int *my_perform_routine(t_int *w)

A pointer ``w`` to an array (of pointer-sized integers) is passed to the
perform function that is inserted into the DSP tree by ``class_add``.

In this array, the pointers passed via ``dsp_add`` are stored.
These pointers must be cast back to their original type.

**N.B.**: The first pointer is stored at ``w[1]`` !!!

The perform function must return a pointer to integer, that points
directly behind the memory, where the object’s pointers are stored. This
means that the return argument equals function argument ``w``, plus
the number of used pointers (as defined in the second argument of
``dsp_add``) plus one.

CLASS\_MAINSIGNALIN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    CLASS_MAINSIGNALIN(<class_name>, <class_data>, <f>);

Macro ``CLASS_MAINSIGNALIN`` declares that the objectclass' first inlet
will accept a signal.

The first macro argument is a pointer to the signal class.
The second argument is the type of the class data space.
The third argument is a (dummy) floating point variable of the data space,
that is needed to automatically convert “float” messages into signals
if no signal is present at the signal inlet.

No “float” methods can be used for signal inlets created this way.

dsp\_add
^^^^^^^^

::

    void dsp_add(t_perfroutine f, int n, ...);

Adds perform function ``f`` to the DSP tree.
The perform function is called at each DSP cycle.

Second argument ``n`` defines the number of the following
pointer arguments.

Which pointers to which data are passed is not limited. Generally,
pointers to the data space of the object and to the signal vectors are
reasonable. The length of the signal vectors should also be passed to
manipulate signals effectively.

dsp\_addv
^^^^^^^^^

::

    void dsp_addv(t_perfroutine f, int n, t_int *vec);

Adds perform function ``f`` to the DSP tree.
The perform function is called at each DSP cycle.

Second argument ``n`` defines the number of arguments passed in
third argument ``vec``.

Third argument ``vec`` holds the pointers to the data to be passed
to perform function ``f``.

This method performs the same operation as *dsp\_add* but is more
flexible, because its array can be manipulated at run-time based on
attributes of the object.
This is how you would create an object with a variable amount of inputs
and/or outputs.

sys\_getsr
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    float sys_getsr(void);

Returns the sample rate of the system.

sys\_getblksize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    int sys_getblksize(void);

Returns the system's top level dsp block size.

*Note*: this isn't necessarily the same as the length of the
signal vector that a signal object is expected to execute on.
A switch~ or block~ object might change that.
An object's "dsp" method has access to the signal vectors
and the *s\_n* entry of any of the t\_signal's passed in
give the length of the signal vector the dsp *perform* function will execute on.

functions: memory
-----------------

getbytes
^^^^^^^^

::

    void *getbytes(size_t nbytes);

Reserves ``nbytes`` bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

copybytes
^^^^^^^^^

::

    void *copybytes(void *src, size_t nbytes);

Copies ``nbytes`` bytes from ``*src`` into a newly allocated memory block.
The address of this memory block is returned.

freebytes
^^^^^^^^^

::

    void freebytes(void *x, size_t nbytes);

Frees ``nbytes`` bytes at address ``*x``.

functions: output
-----------------

post
^^^^

::

    void post(const char *fmt, ...);

Writes a C string to the Pd console.

verbose
^^^^^^^

::

   void verbose(int level, const char *fmt, ...);

Writes a C-string as a verbose message to the Pd-console.
If ``level==0``, the message is only printed if Pd was started in *verbose* mode (``-v`` startup flag).
If ``level==1``, the message is only printed if Pd was started in *more verbose* mode (``-v -v`` startup flags), and so on.


pd_error
^^^^^^^^

::

    void pd_error(void object*, const char *fmt, ...);

Writes a C string as an error message to the Pd console.
The error message is associated with the object that emitted it,
so you can |kbd| Control |nkbd| -click the error message to highlight the object
(or find it via the Pd menu *Find->Find last error*)

The ``object`` must point to your object instance (or be ``NULL``).

logpost
^^^^^^^

::

    void logpost(void object*, const int level, const char *fmt, ...);

Writes a C-string as an message to the Pd-console at a given verbosity.
The message is associated with the object that emitted it, so you can |kbd| Control |nkbd| -Click the error message to highlight the object.

The ``object`` must point to your object instance (or be ``NULL``).

The verbosity ``level`` can have the following values:

+-------+---------------+
| level | severity      |
+=======+===============+
| 0     | fatal         |
+-------+---------------+
| 1     | error         |
+-------+---------------+
| 2     | normal        |
+-------+---------------+
| 3     | verbose       |
+-------+---------------+
| 4     | more verbose  |
+-------+---------------+

error
^^^^^

Previous versions of Pd had an ``error`` function to emit errors,
but this has been removed as it clashed with the function of the same name
in many libc implementations.

Use ``pd_error()`` instead (possibly with a ``NULL`` object)
